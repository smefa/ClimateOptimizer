    readable on the main sensor's `recommended_compensated_outdoor_temp_c`

    without touching the heat pump until the occupant switches it on.

    switch, there is no coordinator-driven auto-disarm: a shared switch over
    N independent plans can't auto-disarm just because one `once` plan
    finished while others may still be scheduled (see the comment at the
    `resolve_vacation_with_return_ramp()` call site in coordinator.py).

    flip once the occupant adds their first plan.
