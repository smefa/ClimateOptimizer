"""(De)serialization of the learner and lag state for persistence.

Pure module — no `homeassistant.*` imports — for the same reason `learner.py`
and `lag.py` are: so the serialization contract can be unit-tested in isolation
without Home Assistant installed. The actual disk I/O (constructing
`homeassistant.helpers.storage.Store`, `async_load`/`async_delay_save`) lives
in `coordinator.py`, which already depends on Home Assistant.

## One deliberate difference from the store this replaces

The old RC-model store rejected any state whose *layout* did not match today's
config, because that estimator's parameter vector changed shape when an
optional input was toggled — and, worse, several different layouts shared a
length, so a naive count check could silently load a learned wind coefficient
into the solar slot.

Nothing here has that problem. The offset table is a fixed number of bins whose
meaning never depends on configuration, so **toggling solar, wind or price
never discards learning**. Switching the wind term off used to throw away weeks
of accumulated evidence; now it changes only which feedforward terms are added
on top of an offset table that keeps everything it knew.

The remaining gates are genuine incompatibilities: a schema version bump, a
model version bump, or structural corruption. All of them return `None` so the
caller cold-starts cleanly rather than crashing on bad data.

## Additive fields do not need a version bump

The baseline table (`baseline_bins`, the per-bin `seeded` flag, `prev_is_active`)
was added to `LearnerState` without bumping `STATE_SCHEMA_VERSION`. All three
are read with `.get()` and a default, so a payload written before they existed
loads exactly as it always did — empty baseline table, every bin unseeded, and
`prev_is_active=False` — while keeping the far more valuable learned offset
table intact. Bumping the version here would cold-start every existing
install's offset table just to gain a table that starts empty anyway, which is
the same throwaway `learner.py`'s own docstring argues against.

The rolling price-spread/median history (`PriceSpreadHistory` from
`heuristic.py`, added for `heuristic.price_significance()`) follows the exact
same rule: it lives under its own top-level `price_spread_history` key,
entirely absent from any payload written before this feature existed, and
`deserialize` reads it with `.get()` and falls back to an empty history — see
`_parse_price_spread_history` — rather than bumping the schema version. Losing
it is cheap by the same reasoning the lag buffer below already established:
it costs a few weeks of reference-building for the price-significance taper,
not the calibrated offset table, so a corrupt or missing one is dropped on its
own instead of taking the far more valuable learner state down with it.
