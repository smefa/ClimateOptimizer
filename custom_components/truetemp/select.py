"""Select platform: the two price-related preferences.

Both are live entities backed by in-memory coordinator values rather than
config options, for the reason given in coordinator.py: an options change
reloads the entry, and these are flipped often — by hand, by season, by
automation. Each restores its own value across restarts via RestoreEntity.

There is no longer a tuning-mode select. Manual and Auto were a choice between
hand-typed coefficients and coefficients derived from a model; there are no
coefficients to type any more, so there is nothing to choose between.
